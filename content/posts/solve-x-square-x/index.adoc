How to solve stem:[\frac{dx^x}{dx}]?

Observe that the expression is a exponential function whoise base and exponent both are an function of stem:[x]. When the base and exponent change with stem:[x], how the expression changes with stem:[x] is quite complicated. To simplify, some techniques can apply to fix part of an expression when taking its derivative.

Define a multivariate function with independent variables stem:[s] and stem:[t]:
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
z = s^t
\end{equation}
++++
where the stem:[s] and stem:[t] are a function of stem:[x]. Simply put, stem:[z] is a function of stem:[x]. Take derivative of stem:[z] involves taking partial derivatives about stem:[x] and stem:[t]. That is, 
[stem]

\begin{equation}
\frac{dz}{dx}=\frac{ds}{dx}\frac{\partial z}{\partial s}+\frac{dt}{dx}\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}.
\end{equation}
++++
When taking partial derivatives, the other independent variables are considered fixed, so the partial derivatives are

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial s} & =ts^{t-1}\\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} & =s^{t}\ln s.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

To solve stem:[\frac{dx^x}{dx}], substitute stem:[s] and stem:[t] with stem:[x] and apply the equations above, which yields
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\frac{dx^{x}}{dx} & =\frac{dz}{dx}|_{s,t=x}\\
 & =\left(ts^{t-1}+s^{t}\ln s\right)|_{s,t=x}\\
 & =x\cdot x^{x-1}+x^{x}\ln x\\
 & =\left(1+\ln x\right)x^{x}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
