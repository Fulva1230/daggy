Consider a problem that we have an ellipse described by a polynomial equation given by

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
x^{T}Ax+B^{T}x+f=0
\end{equation}
++++
where stem:[x,B\in\mathbb{R}^{2}], stem:[A] is a 2 by 2 real symmetric matrix, and stem:[f\in\mathbb{R}].

To find points on the curve, one may first needs to find out the range the ellipse in. 
For example, stem:[a\leq x_{1}\leq b]. And then solving a second-order equation.

That is, setting one variable as a parameter and making the other one be changed according to the equation.
this approach directly deals with the coordinates in the space, 
which may not be the most simple and efficient one to find points on the ellipse.
As an alternative, we can consider the ellipse as an affine transformation of a circle.
We try to find a transformation that stem:[x=St+t_{0}] so that the equation would be
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
t^{T}t=1.
\end{equation}
++++

By substitution, the equation can be
[stem]
++++
t^{T}S^{T}ASt+\left(B^{T}S+2t_{0}^{T}AS\right)t=-B^{T}t_{0}-t_{0}^{T}At_{0}-f
++++
Note that to make stem:[\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}] exist, all the eigenvalues of A must be positve so that they have real square root.

Let's setup some conditions:
[stem]
++++
\begin{cases}
S^{T}AS & =r^{2}\\
B^{T}S+2t_{0}^{T}AS & =0\\
-B^{T}t_{0}-t_{0}^{T}At_{0}-f & =r^{2}.
\end{cases}
++++
If these conditions are satisfied, the equation would be stem:[t^{T}r^{2}t+0t=r^{2}], which is equivelently, stem:[t^{T}t=1].

Now we need to find stem:[S] that satisfies the condition. Since A is a real symmetric matrix, it can be diagonized 
into a form of stem:[A=Q\Lambda Q^{T}] where stem:[Q^{-1}=Q^{T}]. By setting 
stem:[S=rQ\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}], it can be shown that 
[stem]
++++
S^{T}AS=r\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}Q^{T}ArQ\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}=r^{2}\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}Q^{T}Q\Lambda Q^{T}Q\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}=r^{2}
++++

From the second condition, we can solve for stem:[t_{0}]
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
B^{T}S+2t_{0}^{T}AS&=B^{T}rQ\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}+2t_{0}^{T}Q\Lambda Q^{T}rQ\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}\\&=B^{T}Q\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}+2t_{0}^{T}Q\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}\\&=0
\end{aligned}
++++

[stem]
++++
2t_{0}^{T}Q\Lambda Q^{T}=-B^{T}
++++

[stem]
++++
2At_{0}=-B
++++

From the third condition, we can simply solve for stem:[r=\sqrt{-B^{T}t_{0}-t_{0}^{T}At_{0}-f}]

To sum up, an equation of the form of
[stem]
++++
x^{T}Ax+B^{T}x+f=0.
++++
If we can make sure this is an ellipse, then we can find a tranformation of stem:[x=St+t_{0}]

where 
[stem]
++++
\begin{cases}
S & =rQ\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}\\
A & =Q\Lambda Q^{T}\\
2At_{0} & =-B\\
r & =\sqrt{-B^{T}t_{0}-t_{0}^{T}At_{0}-f}
\end{cases},
++++
which make the ellipse in stem:[x] a circle in stem:[t]. That is, stem:[t^{T}t=1] is satisfied.
